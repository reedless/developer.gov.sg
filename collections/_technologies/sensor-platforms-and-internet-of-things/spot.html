<h2>SPOT</h2>
<h3>What is SPOT?</h3>
<p>
  SPOT is a four-legged robot built by Boston Dynamics, and the first robotic
  platform we are developing
  <a
    href="/technologies/sensor-platforms-and-internet-of-things/digital-operations-smart-services"
  >
    DOSS</a
  >
  software capabilities on. As one of the nimblest and most robust robots in the
  market, SPOT is capable of carrying out missions in diverse indoor and outdoor
  environments, including uneven terrains.
</p>
<p>
  DOSS allows SPOT to be piloted remotely and autonomously, with customised
  sensor payloads to meet diverse operational needs.
</p>
<h3>What are some of its hardware features?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Customisable payloads</strong>: SPOT has payload ports to carry
      customised sensor payloads of up to 15 kg.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>360° vision</strong>: SPOT’s inbuilt cameras give it 360° vision.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>All-terrain navigation:</strong> SPOT is equipped with obstacle
      avoidance algorithms and self-right ability. As a four-legged robot, it
      navigates uneven terrains and climbs stairs with ease, going where wheeled
      robots cannot.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>What are some of its software features?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Real-time analytics</strong>: Customised sensor payloads can be
      mounted on SPOT, enhanced with video stream analytics and other deep
      learning-enabled capabilities developed by DOSS. These include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Thermal sensing with human face detection</p></li>
      <li><p>Safe-distancing measurements (distance between two people)</p></li>
      <li><p>People counting</p></li>
      <li><p>Face mask detection</p></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) control</strong>: BVLOS
      control allows SPOT to be piloted remotely anywhere over a 4G or 5G
      connection.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Robotics autonomy</strong>: DOSS is currently developing
      large-scale outdoor autonomy for robots, with SPOT as its first robotic
      platform. Autonomous navigation and operations will enhance remote
      operational capacity and efficiency.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Our team uses machine learning (and especially deep learning) models and
  techniques like computer vision, SLAM (simultaneous localisation and mapping)
  and LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) in autonomy development.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>‘Follow-me’</strong> and <strong>Flock control</strong>: These
      features enable SPOT to work together with human operators and other
      robots.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>What are some use cases of SPOT?</h3>
<p>
  GovTech has been working with government agencies to trial and deploy SPOT in
  diverse settings, including:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Construction and other industrial sites</p></li>
  <li><p>Community isolation facilities</p></li>
  <li><p>Structurally unsound buildings</p></li>
  <li><p>Parks</p></li>
  <li><p>Unstructured outdoor environments</p></li>
</ul>
<p>SPOT has been tested/used for:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Indoor and outdoor 3D terrain mapping</p></li>
  <li><p>Building and safety inspection</p></li>
  <li><p>Hazardous gas detection</p></li>
  <li><p>Security surveillance</p></li>
  <li><p>Situational awareness</p></li>
  <li><p>Thermal sensing</p></li>

        >People counting and safe-distancing measures for COVID-19</a
      >
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>What are some upcoming plans for SPOT?</h3>
<p>
  We are working to enable our sensor and robotic systems to transfer sensor
  data into
  <a href="/technologies/sensor-platforms-and-internet-of-things/sensesurround"
    >Sensesurround</a
  >, a 3D C2 platform for sensor data.
</p>
<p>
  We are also committed to developing large-scale outdoor autonomy and other
  DOSS software capabilities to improve remote robotic operations.
</p>
<h3>How can I get started?</h3>
<p>
  We are currently developing and testing SPOT together with other government
  agencies to meet their various operational needs. To work with us, contact
  <u>sensors@tech.gov.sg</u>.
