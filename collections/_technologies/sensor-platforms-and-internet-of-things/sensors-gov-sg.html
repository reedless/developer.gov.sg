<h2>Sensors.gov.sg Portal</h2>
<h3>What is Sensors.gov.sg?</h3>
<p>
  Sensors.gov.sg is a one-stop portal for government agencies, the private
  industry and citizens to access various Smart Nation Sensor platforms. It also
  provides information on how agencies are utilising sensors in their
  operations.
</p>
<p>
  The Smart Nation Sensor Platform (SNSP) is a Strategic National Project that
  provides whole-of-government products and services. These services allow
  agencies to collect, share and analyse sensor data, and manage IoT and
  robotics systems.
</p>
<p>
  SNSP aims to develop a 360° real-time view of Singapore with spatial-temporal
  sensor data. With these additional insights, government agencies, industries
  and citizens can make data-driven decisions to improve quality of life. SNSP
  collects 360° sensor data from both static and mobile sensor platforms as well
  as data exchange platforms.
</p>
<p>
  SNSP gives you the tools to visualise and act on sensor data in a searchable
  3D virtual environment, bridging the cyber-physical worlds for real-time
  situational awareness and action. For more information on SNSP’s platforms and
  services, visit the links below.
