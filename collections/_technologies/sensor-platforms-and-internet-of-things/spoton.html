<h2>SPOTON</h2>
<h3>What is SPOTON?</h3>
<p>
  SPOTON is a smart thermal scanner developed under the
  <a
    href="/technologies/sensor-platforms-and-internet-of-things/digital-operations-smart-services"
    >Digital Operations Smart Services (DOSS) platform</a
  >. SPOTON can screen up to ten people at once, with a temperature indicator
  for each face and automated alarms and email alerts when high temperatures are
  detected.
</p>
<p>
  With SPOTON, fast crowd temperature screening is enabled by detecting and
  alerting operators to individuals with high temperatures. This minimises
  physical contact and time spent on manual temperature checks.
</p>
<p>
  As a hybrid AI solution, it combines affordable, commercial off-the-shelf
  hardware (a long-wave infrared camera and RGB-Depth camera) with advanced
  software capabilities like deep learning human face detection. This
  combination makes SPOTON significantly more affordable than most commercially
  available scanners without compromising on accuracy.
</p>
<p>
  Measuring just 90mm x 85mm x 30mm, SPOTON is a lightweight mobile device that
  can be easily deployed both indoors and outdoors with a simple calibration
  process.
</p>
<h3>What are the features available?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Human face detection </strong>–<strong> </strong>SPOTON recognises
      only humans, not objects. It is not affected by masks, hats and
      headdresses, or by hot and cold objects (such as drinks).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Colour-coded temperature indicators per face</strong> – SPOTON
      displays the temperature detected on a colour-coded bounding box
      surrounding each face: Green for temperatures under 37.5°C and red for
      temperatures above 37.5°C.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Detects up to 10 faces at once</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Alarm</strong> and <strong>email alerts</strong> – When SPOTON
      detects a temperature above 37.5°C, it triggers an alarm and email alerts
      to operators. Snapshots of high temperatures detected are automatically
      saved into a local folder.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>±0.3-0.5°C accuracy</strong> within a
      <strong>1.5-2m range</strong>*
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <em
    >*In calibration tests conducted with the National Metrology Centre (NMC),
    SPOTON demonstrated an accuracy of ±0.28°C–0.33 °C for temperature ranges of
    36°C, 37°C and 38°C, with NMC’s recommended pixel count of 10(V) by 10(H) at
    a distance of 1.65m.</em

<h3>What are some use cases of SPOTON?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong
        >SPOTON comes in handy for any environment with high footfall</strong
      >. It helps you save time and labour on temperature screening while
      keeping your operators and visitors safe.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>SPOTON has been tested and deployed in different settings</strong
      >, including office buildings, community centres, places of worship,
      retail spaces and community isolation facilities.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong
        >SPOTON can be deployed at any indoor or outdoor environment</strong
      >
      (away from direct sunlight and with a stable ambient temperature).
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>What are some upcoming plans for SPOTON?</h3>
<p>
  For SPOTON v2.0, we are developing API extensibility for seamless integration
  with other IoT or robotic systems. We are also working on developing more
  deep-learning algorithms to expand SPOTON’s capabilities beyond thermal
  scanning.
</p>
<h3>How can I get started?</h3>
<p>
  As countries continue their efforts in tackling COVID-19, we hope to make the
  SPOTON software available to the industry and tech community in the future. To
