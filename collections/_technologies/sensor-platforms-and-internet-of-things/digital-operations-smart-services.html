<h2>Digital Operations Smart Services (DOSS)</h2>
<h3>What is DOSS?</h3>
<p>
  Digital Operations Smart Services (DOSS) is an operations management platform
  for static and mobile sensor platforms, including robotics. With DOSS, we are
  developing new capabilities in real-time analytics, sensor data and deep
  learning techniques to power flexible sensors, robotic solutions and our
  digital operations.
</p>
<h3>What are the features available?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Real-time analytics:</strong> Using standalone static sensors and
      sensor payloads mounted on robots, DOSS is developing video stream
      analytics and other deep learning-enabled capabilities, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Thermal sensing with human face detection (SPOTON v1.0)</p></li>
      <li><p>Safe-distancing measurements (distance between two people)</p></li>
      <li><p>People counting</p></li>
      <li><p>Face mask detection</p></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) control:</strong> BVLOS
      control allows robots to be piloted remotely anywhere over a 4G or 5G
      connection.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Robotics autonomy:</strong> DOSS is developing large-scale outdoor
      robotics autonomy to enhance remote operational capacity and efficiency.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Our team uses machine learning models (especially deep learning) and
  techniques like computer vision, Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM),
  and Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) in autonomy development.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>‘Follow-me’</strong> and <strong>Flock control:</strong> These
      features enable robots to work together with human operators and other
      robots.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>What are its sub-products?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Robotics C2 platform</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  DOSS is developing key software capabilities under a command and control (C2)
  platform for autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). This lightweight and flexible
  platform works with any robotic system to operate AMRs over land, air and sea
  – usually for tasks that are monotonous, high-risk or unsuitable for humans to
  perform.

    ><u>SPOT</u></a
  >
</p>
<p>
  SPOT is a four-legged robot built by Boston Dynamics and the first robotic
  platform we are developing DOSS software capabilities on.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Smart systems and sensor payloads</strong></p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  DOSS is also developing smart sensor systems that can be deployed as
  standalone static sensors or as payloads mounted on robots.
</p>
<p>
  <a
    href="/technologies/sensor-platforms-and-internet-of-things/spoton"
    rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
    ><u>SPOTON</u></a
  >
</p>
<p>
  SPOTON (v1.0) is a smart thermal scanner, and the first smart sensor payload
  we are developing using the DOSS platform.
</p>
<h3>What are some upcoming plans for DOSS?</h3>
<p>
  DOSS will soon offer seamless integration with our smart sensor and robotic
  systems via APIs. We are also working to enable our sensor and robotic systems
  to transfer sensor data into
  <a href="/technologies/sensor-platforms-and-internet-of-things/sensesurround"
    >Sensesurround</a
  >, a 3D C2 platform for sensor data.
</p>
<p>
  We are developing large-scale outdoor autonomy and other software capabilities
  to improve remote robotic operations. Autonomous mobile robots, including
  drones and underwater robots (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles and Remotely
  Operated Vehicles), will provide us with 360° real-time sensor data and smart
  operations over land, air and sea.
</p>
<p>
  We are also developing new smart sensor payload capabilities under SPOTON 2.0.
