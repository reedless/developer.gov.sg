<h2>What is SENSEOPS?</h2>
<p>
  The developing COVID-19 situation has necessitated the implementation of safe
  distancing measures.
</p>
<p>
  Currently, enforcement officers and safe distancing ambassadors are deployed
  island-wide on a daily basis to ensure that safe distancing measures are
  observed. With many agencies involved in these efforts, cross-agency sharing
  of information is vital for the planning, coordination and reporting of their
  safe distancing operations.
</p>
<p>
  To address these needs and enhance the efficiency of safe distancing
  operations, we developed the SENSEOPS dashboard using Sensesurround as its
  base. SENSEOPS is a visualisation and dashboarding tool that provides
  situational awareness - using the relevant data - to support agencies’ safe
  distancing operations on the ground.
</p>
<h3>What are the features available?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>All your data on one platform:</strong> SENSEOPS dashboard pulls
      in relevant and real-time data from different sources, and integrates it
      into a single platform for easy visualisation. Data include safe
      distancing cases and crowd population.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Separate map and dashboard layers:</strong> SENSEOPS features both
      map and dashboard layers, each of which offers different information and
      capabilities for agencies. For example, the map layer allows agencies to
      visualise hotspots, while the dashboard layer summarises trends in safe
      distancing cases over time.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
