<h2>Sensor Asset Management (SAM)</h2>
<h3>What is SAM?</h3>
<p>
  The Sensor Asset Management (SAM) is a web-based portal that provides a
  holistic overview of the sensor landscape in Singapore on a real-time 3D map.
  SAM enables government agencies to register and share sensor and robotic
  assets.
</p>
<p>
  Through search and filter functions by parameters like location and dataset,
  your agency can visualise any assets and data of interest on a single
  platform, gaining situational awareness for your planning and operational
  needs.
</p>
<h3>What are the features available?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Sensor asset registry:</strong> You can register sensor and
      robotic assets by location.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Search/filter:</strong> You can search and locate all registered
      public and private-sector sensor and robotic assets in Singapore and
      filter by relevant datasets.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Real-time 3D visualisation:</strong> You can view sensor devices'
      metadata, latest readings and other available contextual data in real-time
      on a 3D map. By using the search and filter functions, you can get a
      customised view for your specific needs.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Workflow engine:</strong> You can set up customised workflows for
      operations.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>What are some use cases of SAM?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Planning</strong> – Search and visualise sensor assets and
      datasets on a 3D map according to your specific needs, such as sensor
      deployment and operational planning.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Data sharing </strong>– Get a holistic overview of the sensor data
      landscape in Singapore and subscribe to the datasets you want through the
      Sensor Data Exchange (SDX).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>Operations</strong> – Monitor sensor readings in real-time or set
      up workflows with automated alerts, for data-driven decision-making.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>What are some upcoming plans?</h3>
<p>
  SAM is currently in development, with its first release set to support
  government-owned sensor and robotic assets. We are working towards making SAM
  available to both the industry and citizens by 2022.
</p>
<h3>How can I get started?</h3>
<p>
  Government agencies interested in finding out more about SAM or onboarding
  their sensor assets and data to SAM may write in to
  <u>sensors@tech.gov.sg</u>.
