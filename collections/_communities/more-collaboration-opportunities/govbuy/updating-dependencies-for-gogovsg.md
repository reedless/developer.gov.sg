### The task

As part of efforts to enable automatic updates to our dependencies, we need to first do a manual one-off update and verify that GoGovSG still works. This will be done in phases, starting with all dependencies relating to linting.

### The project

[go.gov.sg](https://go.gov.sg), the official Singapore government link shortener, built by the Open Government Products team in GovTech.

### The team

[Open Government Products](https://open.gov.sg/)

### Deliverables

Dependencies relating to ESLint - including ESLint itself, configs and plugins - should be updated to the latest versions in a single PR, with checks to ensure that linting continues to work for the core engineering team.

The PR should also resolve GitHub issue [#161](https://github.com/opengovsg/GoGovSG/issues/161) by adding the appropriate ESLint plugin. Ensure changes to code via linting, if any, are within reason and documented
